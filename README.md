# Software-Requirement-Specification-Document-Analysis-and-Parameter-Identification-Using-ML

The objective of this study is to improve software development efficiency and correctness by automating the analysis of Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents using machine learning techniques. Manually analyzing SRS documents is often time-consuming and prone to errors, making automation a valuable solution. A sample dataset consisting of 94 records was created. Each record included a sentence having a requirement, paired with a corresponding parameter such as Availability, Pricing Models, and others. The dataset was pre-processed by removing missing values, and the parameters were encoded using a Label Encoder. An 80:20 split was applied and divided data into two terms, which are training and testing sets. A machine learning pipeline was developed, utilizing a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical form and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for sentence classification. The dataset was used to train model, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess its performance. To evaluate model's categorization performance, a confusion matrix was created. The trained model and the label encoder were saved as .pkl files using joblib for future use, making the system easily reusable. For more functionality, PDF text extraction was incorporated using the PyMuPDF library. These sentences are classified into predefined parameters using the trained model. Furthermore, a chatbot was integrated using Flask and Lang chain to assist users with clarifications related to the classification results. Overall, this research successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to automate SRS document analysis, reducing manual effort, improving accuracy, and offering a practical tool for software developers in real-world scenarios.
